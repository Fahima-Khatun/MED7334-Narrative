# MED7334 Narrative on the MA in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University

This repo contains resources for students on the [MA Data Journalism](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism) at Birmingham City University. The course module in Narrative covers a range of techniques for telling data stories across text, video and audio, visual and interactive forms, and web, chat and social platforms.

Most resources for the module can be found in the [Narrative Moodle website](http://moodle.bcu.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=14318). This repo contains extra resources and activities specific to data journalism.

## Module Synopsis

Narrative: from media to interactive media aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset that provides a basis for you to critically adapt to both new and existing storytelling technologies. 

Structurally the module begins by building applied understanding of narrative structures across a range of media based on a combination of case studies and individual exploration, before supporting you in developing and executing planning around narrative projects. Both stages are closely aligned to the core assignment tasks. The first stage of the module provides a platform for you to identify and critically evaluate narrative techniques used within relevant media, with a balance to reflect your own study focus, while the second stage support you in initiating and developing techniques to produce a media artefact (whether innovative, conventional or emerging narrative) within an identified professional context. These techniques include core media production skills required for developing the basis for a masters level dissertation/ practical project. Normative assessment of work at the end of the first stage is used to inform increased emphasis on production in stage 2. 

A mixed methods and team teaching pedagogical approach is adopted, with lectures by experts combined with hands-on workshops where you are asked to critically evaluate their own work and the work of others. Supplementary technical sessions may be required to provide specialist skills with particular media to a required professional standard. The critical evaluation of early work is then synthesised with narrative planning culminating in a project that demonstrates the application of editorial, creative and practical skills across multiple media contexts. This links to the different core semester two modules and Work Placement module.

## Learning outcomes

* Initiate and develop innovative, conventional or emerging narrative techniques to produce a media artefact within an identified professional context
* Identify and critically evaluate narrative techniques used within relevant media

## Week by week outline

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.

## Week 1: Telling stories - and the problems with them

By the end of this week you should be able to identify narrative elements in potential stories and begin to map out potential stories in areas of interest.

* Workshop & reading: see Moodle
* Task: Critical review of news structure in data stories

## Week 2: Structure: shortform, longform and other forms

By the end of this week you should be able to describe and execute various techniques for telling stories in shortform media (e.g. social media updates), longform formats, and identify structure in genre forms such as the inverted pyramid.

* Workshop & reading: see Moodle
